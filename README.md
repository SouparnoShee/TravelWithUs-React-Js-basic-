To see it in your production
install all the packages needed, 
I used Bootstrap 5.0.0
used react router dom
obviously, install the create recat app to initialize, 
This application provides a form validation and 
There is a ready logic given in the form, inside the onchange event which you can use in any backend and for now I just used and incorporated in a alert option
